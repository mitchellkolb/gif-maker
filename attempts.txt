1. Use Python FFI (Foreign Function Interface) with Rust

    Rust FFI and ctypes or cffi: You can compile the Rust Gifski library as a shared library (e.g., .so file on Linux) and use Python’s ctypes or cffi to call Rust functions directly from Python. This allows Python to interact with Rust functions as if they were regular Python functions.
    Pros: This approach offers high performance and doesn’t involve using the command line, keeping things smooth.
    Cons: Writing Rust code compatible with ctypes can be challenging, as you have to be cautious with memory management and data types.


Foreign Function Interface (FFI) with ctypes or cffi

    Rust Library Code: Create a Rust library with functions that can be called from Python.

// src/lib.rs
#[no_mangle] // Ensures the Rust function has a predictable name in the compiled library
pub extern "C" fn add_numbers(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a + b
}

Compile as a Shared Library: Run the following command to compile the library as a .so file on Linux.

cargo build --release

Python Code: Use ctypes to load and call functions from the compiled library.

    import ctypes

    # Load the shared library
    lib = ctypes.CDLL('./target/release/libyour_library_name.so')

    # Define the function prototype
    lib.add_numbers.argtypes = (ctypes.c_int, ctypes.c_int)
    lib.add_numbers.restype = ctypes.c_int

    # Call the function
    result = lib.add_numbers(5, 7)
    print("Result:", result)

This example shows how to call a Rust function that adds two numbers from Python. You can extend this to wrap any Gifski functions you need.








2. Use PyO3 to Build Python Bindings in Rust

    PyO3 is a Rust crate specifically designed for creating Python bindings. It allows you to write Rust code that Python can import as a module.
    How it works: You write a Rust function (e.g., generate_gif) and expose it as a Python module using PyO3. Your PyQt Python code can then import this Rust-compiled module and directly call functions from it.
    Pros: This is a more modern, Rust-native approach that offers direct integration with Python, simplifying cross-language interactions.
    Cons: You’ll need to manage Rust’s memory model alongside Python’s garbage collection, and compiling requires configuring maturin or setuptools-rust.


PyO3 Python Bindings

    Rust Code: Use PyO3 to define a Rust function that Python can call directly.

use pyo3::prelude::*;
use pyo3::wrap_pyfunction;

#[pyfunction]
fn add_numbers(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a + b
}

#[pymodule]
fn your_rust_module(py: Python, m: &PyModule) -> PyResult<()> {
    m.add_function(wrap_pyfunction!(add_numbers, m)?)?;
    Ok(())
}

Configure PyO3 and Build: Add pyo3 to your Cargo.toml and configure it.

[dependencies]
pyo3 = { version = "0.17", features = ["extension-module"] }

Compile and Install: Use maturin or setuptools-rust to compile and install as a Python package.

maturin develop  # This installs the Rust module as a Python package

Python Code: You can now import and use the Rust function directly in Python.

    import your_rust_module

    result = your_rust_module.add_numbers(5, 7)
    print("Result:", result)

This approach integrates Rust functions directly as Python modules, allowing seamless access to Gifski functions without intermediate subprocess calls.












3. Subprocess Calls (Your Original Idea)

    Your original idea of invoking CLI commands via Python’s subprocess module can still be useful, particularly if you only need a few Gifski functions.
    Pros: It’s simple to implement and doesn’t require additional bindings or complex integration.
    Cons: Limited control and potentially less efficient due to the additional overhead of subprocesses, especially if the CLI calls are frequent.

Subprocess Calls to the CLI (Your Original Idea)

    Python Code: Use subprocess to run Gifski’s command-line interface, triggered by GUI actions in your PyQt application.

    import subprocess
    import sys
    from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication, QMainWindow, QPushButton, QFileDialog

    class GifskiApp(QMainWindow):
        def __init__(self):
            super().__init__()

            # Set up the main window
            self.setWindowTitle("Gifski GUI")
            self.setGeometry(100, 100, 600, 400)

            # Button to open a file dialog and select a video
            self.button = QPushButton("Convert to GIF", self)
            self.button.clicked.connect(self.convert_to_gif)
            self.button.resize(150, 40)
            self.button.move(225, 180)

        def convert_to_gif(self):
            # Open a file dialog to select a video file
            video_file, _ = QFileDialog.getOpenFileName(self, "Select Video", "", "Video Files (*.mp4 *.mov *.avi)")
            if video_file:
                # Run Gifski CLI command with subprocess
                output_gif = video_file.replace('.mp4', '.gif')
                result = subprocess.run(['gifski', '-o', output_gif, video_file])

                if result.returncode == 0:
                    print(f"GIF created successfully at {output_gif}")
                else:
                    print("Error during GIF conversion")

    # Run the PyQt application
    app = QApplication(sys.argv)
    window = GifskiApp()
    window.show()
    sys.exit(app.exec_())

In this example, the GUI triggers Gifski’s CLI to convert a video file to a GIF without exposing terminal commands to the user. This approach allows for easy debugging and control over the command line.
